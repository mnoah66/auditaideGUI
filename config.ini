instructions = 1. The data file to be scanned must be an '.xlsx' file, where columns:
	
	A = The note
	B = The identifer of the individual/consumer
	C = The contact date of the note
	D = The name of the program
	E = The Start time
	F = The End time
	G = The duration of the note in minutes
	H = The note writer/creator
	
	The "Active Worksheet" is the default worksheet selection, based on what sheet was active at the time the user last saved the workbook.  If the scan results in no data, check to see if a different worksheet is the active sheet by opening the workbook, selecting the correct sheet, and save and close the workbook.
	
	2. Enter the settings to be scanned.  Use the 'Enable' check buttons to enable or disable any of the scans.  Check the 'Inverse' button to flag all notes that don't contain the list of words/phrases.
	
	3. Choose a file to be scanned by clicking the "Browse file to be scanned" button.
	
	4. Choose or confirm the location you want the output file to be saved to.
	
	5. Click the RUN button to begin the scan.
	
	6. When the scan is finished, a label will appear under the RUN button indicating it is finished.  A link to the output file will also be displayed.  Once clicked, the output file disappears.
	
	Note: the list of keywords/phrases finds literal matches.  For example, if you put the two letters 'ER' (emergency room) as a word to be searched, all results containing 'er' will be found, including false positives (over, cover, peer, etc.).  To only find matches of ' ER ' you must add a '?' before and after the word to be searched: ?ER?
